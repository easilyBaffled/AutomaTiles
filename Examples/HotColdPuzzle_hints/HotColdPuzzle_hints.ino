/*  Puzzle of Fire and Ice (Game)
 *  
 *  Setup: 1 or 2 player game. Rubik's cube like in that the tiles are arranged in a solved state, set,
 *         and then the puzzle is messed up with a goal of finding the solved arrangement
 *  
 *  Technical Details:
 *    Press button to set the solution array (i.e. on press, record where neighbors are present and save to array)
 * 
 *    The tiles need to first determine if they themselves are solved,
 *    then through a back and forth with neighboring tiles, determine
 *    if their neighbors are solved and only celebrate if that is verified
 *    across the entire network of tiles
 *    
 *    States for game piece
 *    0 = no piece (never in state 0)
 *    1 = present and unsolved
 *    2 = present and satisfied
 *    3 = present and satisfied and attached to satisfied piece
 *    4 = present and satisfied and attached to satisfied piece for n seconds (WIN STATE!!!) CELEBRATE

 *  IMPORTANT: To use this code in Arduino's IDE, first move the AutomaTiles folder
 *  into the right directory i.e. <user home directory>/Documents/Arduino/hardware/AutomaTiles
 *  Then open the Arduino IDE and select Tools > Board > "AutomaTile"
 *  Now you should be good to go :) (thanks to the hard work of Joshua Sloane)
